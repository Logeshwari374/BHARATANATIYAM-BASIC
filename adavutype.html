          <H2>Tatta Adavu</H2>
           <p>Tatta is a word with many meanings, but in this adavu we are taught the Bharatanatyam way of leg tapping. This style involves only using your legs rather than all four limbs like other styles do- it’s more advanced!</p> 
            
           <h2>Natta Adavu</h2> 
            <p>The adavu in “Natta” means to stretch and so it involves some stretching compared with the tatte adavus we explored earlier. And as opposed to Tanta’davao, this one has heel contacts of your feet during performance which gives rise for word “Nattu” (stretch) also referring perching on heels.
          </p>  
            <h2>Visharu Adavu</h2>
           <p>Visharada is a technique that involves swinging of hands in different directions, such as sideways and up-and down. The legs should move straight forward without any side to it for this adavu posture – also called Mardita Adavu or Paraval Adavu (depending on where you are located).
